## Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLP
Overview: This project implements and compares six sentiment classification models on the SemEval 2017 Task 4A dataset, which requires categorizing tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The objective is to explore the performance trade-offs between traditional machine learning algorithms and modern deep learning architectures in a real-world social media context.
