## üß† Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing
This project implements and compares six sentiment classification models on the SemEval 2017 Task 4A dataset, which requires categorizing tweets into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The objective is to explore the performance trade-offs between traditional machine learning algorithms and modern deep learning architectures in a real-world social media context.

üîç Key Highlights
Dataset: SemEval 2017 Task 4A ‚Äì annotated Twitter data

Preprocessing: Twitter-specific text cleaning (e.g., URL removal, hashtag parsing, mention normalization)

Feature Engineering:

TF-IDF (unigrams and bigrams)

Pre-trained GloVe embeddings

Contextual embeddings from BERT and BERTweet

Models Implemented:

Support Vector Machine (SVM) with GloVe

Gaussian Naive Bayes with GloVe

Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF

Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe

Bidirectional LSTM with BERT

Bidirectional LSTM with BERTweet (Twitter-optimized RoBERTa)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, training time, and class-wise performance

Experiments: Analysis of stopword removal effects on classifier performance

This project demonstrates how domain-specific preprocessing, word representation, and model selection significantly affect sentiment analysis accuracy, especially when dealing with informal and noisy social media data.
