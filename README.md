# PortfolioProjects
ðŸ’¬ Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLP
Project Goal:
Build and evaluate sentiment classifiers on Twitter data using SemEval 2017 Task 4A, classifying tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. This project compares traditional machine learning models with deep learning architectures using both static and contextual word embeddings.

Techniques Used:

Preprocessing Twitter-specific text (mentions, hashtags, URLs)

Text representation using TF-IDF, GloVe, BERT, and BERTweet

Modeling with:

SVM + GloVe

GaussianNB + GloVe

MultinomialNB + TF-IDF

LSTM + GloVe

LSTM + BERT

LSTM + BERTweet

Evaluation using F1 Score, confusion matrices, and training time analysis

Experiments on the impact of stopword removal
