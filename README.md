## Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLP
*(Short Overview)*  
This project explores sentiment classification on SemEval 2017 tweets, comparing traditional machine learning (SVM, Naive Bayes) with deep learning (LSTM) using GloVe, BERT, and BERTweet embeddings. Key experiments include handling Twitter-specific text, assessing stopword removal, and measuring performance via accuracy and F1 scores.

- **Path to code**: [`/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis`](./Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis/)
- **Main Features**:
  - Preprocessing (URLs, hashtags, mentions, stopwords)
  - Modeling with SVM, Naive Bayes, and LSTM architectures
  - Evaluating metrics (Accuracy, F1) and training times
